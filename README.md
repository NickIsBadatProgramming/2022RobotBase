A basic tool used for preparing 2023's robot code. 

Implementations:

* WPILib Swerve Kinematics

* Field-oriented swerve 

* Joystick used as main driving utility

* More to come in the future

Ideally we would have all of these working fully, but it will take testing and revision to see if it works. 

We also don't fully know what the robot will look like during the 2023 season, so improvements and add-ons are inevitable
